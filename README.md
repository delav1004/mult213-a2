## MULT213 Assignment 2 (Assignment 1 remote git repository)

Repository to learn about remote repositories on github.

### About the project in the repository: 
A pokedex website that displays all the pokemons and their stats. Such as number, name, type, weight, height, and much more!
Some skills and techniques used for this website are:
- HTML
- CSS 
- JSON
- JavaScipt
To create this website I used the pokedex.json file to obtain the information about the pokemons and then liked it to my own html file in order to style it.
I also included some calculations based on the JSON file like the total of pokemons, heavyest pokemon, aveage weigth, tallest pokemon, average height, and pokemon with the highest average spawns.
